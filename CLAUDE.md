# Working in this repository

Building and testing: the README's "Building and testing locally" section. Gradle runs on the Temurin 21 that
`mise install` provides, `./gradlew test` is what CI runs, and `./gradlew formatDiff` formats the files you changed.

## Conventions for new code

- **Collections.** Plain `java.util` types. `List.of`, `List.copyOf`, `Map.of` and `Stream.toList()` give
  unmodifiable collections, so new code does not need Guava's `ImmutableList` or `ImmutableMap`; use them only
  where an existing API already hands one over.
- **Nullability.** One annotation, `javax.annotation.Nullable` (jsr305), the one the code uses; do not add another
  `Nullable`.
- **Local variables.** `var` wherever the initializer gives the type unchanged, in `for` loops too. Not where it
  would box a primitive (`for (var n : List<Integer>)`), and not without an initializer that has a type of its own
  (a lambda, `null`).
- **Immutability annotations.** Do not add Error Prone's `@Immutable` or `@SuppressWarnings("Immutable")`.
- **License header.** A new file starts with the Apache 2.0 header alone, without a copyright line:

  ```java

  ```

  Files inherited from google-java-format and palantir-java-format keep their original headers.
