# Working in this repository

Building and testing: the README's "Building and testing locally" section. Gradle runs on the Temurin 21 that
`mise install` provides, `./gradlew test` is what CI runs, and `./gradlew formatDiff` formats the files you changed.

## Conventions for new code

- **Collections.** Plain `java.util` types. `List.of`, `List.copyOf`, `Map.of` and `Stream.toList()` give
  unmodifiable collections; unlike Guava's, `Set.of` and `Map.of` do not keep insertion order, and `contains(null)`
  on them throws. Guava's `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableMap` and `ImmutableSet` are banned by forbidden-apis
  (`config/forbidden-apis`), which fails the build, in every module but the SPI: `FormatterService` keeps returning
  `ImmutableList` for compatibility, and the methods that implement it carry their module's `@SuppressForbidden`.
- **Nullability.** One annotation, JSpecify's `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable`; do not add another `Nullable`,
  nor a `NotNull` or `NonNull`: what is not `@Nullable` is non-null, and NullAway checks it. It is a type-use
  annotation, so on a nested type it goes before the simple name (`Input.@Nullable Token`), and on an array before
  the brackets (`String @Nullable []`).
- **Local variables.** `var` wherever the initializer gives the type unchanged, in `for` loops too. Not where it
  would box a primitive (`for (var n : List<Integer>)`), and not without an initializer that has a type of its own
  (a lambda, `null`).
- **Immutability annotations.** Do not add Error Prone's `@Immutable` or `@SuppressWarnings("Immutable")`.
- **License header.** A new file starts with the Apache 2.0 header alone, without a copyright line:

  Files inherited from google-java-format and palantir-java-format keep their original headers.
